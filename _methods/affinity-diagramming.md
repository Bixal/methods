## How to do it

1. Record ideas, quotes, or observations from [interviews]({{ site.baseurl }}/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/), [contextual inquiry]({{ site.baseurl }}/discover/contextual-inquiry), or other sources of research on sticky notes.
1. Place the sticky notes on a white board (in no particular arrangement). Move the sticky notes into related groups.
1. Use larger notes (or white board markers, if you're using a white board), to write titles or catch phrases for each group.
