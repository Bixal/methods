timeRequired: 1â€“2 hours

## How to do it

1. Recruit a group of three to five people familiar with heuristic evaluation methods. 
    - Evaluators do not necessarily need to be designers, but they should be familiar with common usability best practices.
    - Ideally, they are not users or overly familiar with the site being evaluated.  
1. Provide a set of recognized heuristics for the group to evaluate the site against.
    - The most common resource is [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) from Nielsen Norman Group.
    - The checklist for [Play 3: Make it simple and intuitive](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play3) from the Digital Services Playbook is also a good resource.
1. Have each person evaluate the website using the provided heuristics and document problems.
    - Optionally, have them capture a severity level and potential solution (if apparent) for each problem.
1. Review the data and prioritize problems to address.

## Considerations for use in government  

No PRA Implications, as heuristic evaluations usually include a small number of evaluators. If conducted with nine or fewer members of the public, the PRA does not apply, 5 CFR 1320.5(c)4. If participants are employees, the PRA does not apply. See the methods for [Recruiting]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/recruiting/) and [Privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
