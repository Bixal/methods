## How to do it

### Seek out people who
- Are trying to use the thing you are working on right at that very moment.
- Recently tried to use the thing you are working on.
- Used the thing you are working on less recently.
- Have used something like what you are working on, and are likely to use what you are working on.  

### Reach them through
- Relevant community organizations.
- Impromptu requests in or near the relevant environment.
- Your personal and professional network.
- The new or existing website.
- Existing mailing lists.
