## What

A tree test evaluates a hierarchical category structure (tree) of the website by having users find the locations in the tree where specific tasks can be completed. It can be done for the whole website or parts of the website. It's recommended to conduct tree testing after card sorting and before designing page layouts or navigation menus.

## Why
To evaluate, explore and refine proposed menu structure, labels and information categories and quickly check how easy people find information on the website and where they get lost while trying to complete a task.

## How to do it

1. Build tree. 
- A tree is a text-only version of hierarchy, similar to a sitemap. It's a complete list of all content categories and subcategories. 
- Include the full depth down to the lowest level of subcategories you want to test. 
- Each subcategory should provide the full list of all the options in that area in order to elicit realistic behavior from participants who often evaluate link labels by comparing them with nearby alternatives. 
2. Define tasks.
- The tasks are instructions that explain to participants what they should attempt to find. 
- Decide which categories and labels to target. 
- Ask users to find something contained within the category. Include tasks that target key website goals and user tasks as well as potential problem areas (e.g. new proposed categories). Write tasks that reflect how your users might naturally approach your website. Write in natural plain language and avoid using tree labels in the tasks.
- Set at least one correct destination for every task on the tree. 
- Match the number of tasks to the parts of the tree that you want to test. Have no more than 10 tasks per tree test, to avoid low completion rates or participant getting too familiar with the tree.
3. Run the test. 
- Tree test is often executed as a remote unmoderated study. After recruiting participants, send them the link to the test, and the testing tool will walk them through the process. Optimal Workshop it the tool that allows to set up and run unmoderated tree tests, called Tree Jack
- It is recommended to conduct a few moderated sessions beforehand, to ensure the tasks are understood by participants and to ask personalized follow up questions to get context of user behavior that can otherwise be hard to spot in the quantitative data.
4. Analyze results. The test tool will give you results in the following numbers relationships between which will need further interpreting:
- "Success rate" shows the persentage of testers who successfully completed each task
- "Directness" the percentage of testers who successfully completed each task without making wrong guesses first
- "Time" - the average time needed to complete each task
- "First click" - where most testers clicked first for each task
- "Destination" - where most people finished for each task, their final answer, correct or otherwise

## Considerations for use in government  

Due to the size of statistically significant sample for unmoderated tree test being 50 people, tree testing is subject to PRA implications.
