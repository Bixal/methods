## Considerations for use in government  

No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3. It also specifically excludes tests of knowledge or aptitude, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)7, which is essentially what a usability test tests. See the methods for [Recruiting]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/recruiting/) and [Privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
