description: A test to see how well people can navigate to the intended location of a given website structure. Conduct tree testing after card sorting to increase confidence in navigation content.
category: Validation
why: To validate how well users understand the labels, categories, and organization of a proposed website structure, and learn where they may get lost while trying to complete a task.
timeRequired: 30 minutes to 1 hour per test

## How to do it

1. Build the tree. 
- Use a tool like [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) or a spreadsheet to create a site hierarchy, including all the categories and subcategories you want to test.
- Provide options for each subcategory to prompt realistic behavior from participants who often evaluate link labels by comparing them with alternatives. 
2. Define tasks.
- The tasks are instructions that explain to participants what they should attempt to find. 
- Decide which categories and labels to target. 
- Ask users to find something contained within the category. Include tasks that target key website goals and user tasks as well as potential problem areas (e.g. new proposed categories). Write tasks that reflect how your users might naturally approach your website. Write in natural plain language and avoid using tree labels in the tasks.
- Set at least one correct destination for every task on the tree. 
- Match the number of tasks to the parts of the tree that you want to test. Have no more than 10 tasks per tree test, to avoid low completion rates or participant getting too familiar with the tree.
3. Run the test. 
- Tree test is often executed as a remote unmoderated study. After recruiting participants, send them the link to the test, and the testing tool will walk them through the process. Optimal Workshop it the tool that allows to set up and run unmoderated tree tests, called Tree Jack
- It is recommended to conduct a few moderated sessions beforehand, to ensure the tasks are understood by participants and to ask personalized follow up questions to get context of user behavior that can otherwise be hard to spot in the quantitative data.
4. Analyze results. The test tool will give you results in the following numbers relationships between which will need further interpreting:
- "Success rate" shows the persentage of testers who successfully completed each task
- "Directness" the percentage of testers who successfully completed each task without making wrong guesses first
- "Time" - the average time needed to complete each task
- "First click" - where most testers clicked first for each task
- "Destination" - where most people finished for each task, their final answer, correct or otherwise

## Considerations for use in government  

Due to the size of statistically significant sample for unmoderated tree test being 50 people, tree testing is subject to PRA implications. See the methods for [Recruiting]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/recruiting/) and [Privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/privacy/) for more tips on taking input from the public.
