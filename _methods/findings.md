what: The findings communicate what you did, what you learn, and what it means for what comes next.
why: For research to be actionable, the findings from each cycle have to be communicated to the team and other stakeholders clearly and confidently.

## How to do it

1. Download the template for [research cycle findings](/methods/templates/Research%20Cycle%20Findings.docx) (Word).
1. Collaborate with others on the team who participated in the research cycle, either as facilitators or observers. (Findings are about documenting what happened. People who weren't involved directly are consumers of this information, not contributors.)
1. Ensure that your findings clearly connect the dots between the following:
  1. What your questions were
  1. What you did
  1. What you saw
  1. What you learned
  1. What you think it means
1. Use the template to document your findings, but also consider alternate formats for actually presenting the findings. Sharing more concise slides that include imagery and even video clips are more impactful than scrolling through a Word document or expecting people to read it on their own.

## Considerations for use in government  

No PRA implications, for the findings themselves, but make sure the privacy of your participants is being protected as part of any artifacts that are included.
