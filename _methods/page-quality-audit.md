## How to do it

1. Go to [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure/).
1. Enter the address of the page you want to audit and press `Run Audit`.
1. Have team members provide effort estimates for issues in their area of expertise. There may be issues relating to content, design, and development across each of the four categories.
1. Open the `View Report` link and save the address to return to this version of the report later or share it with others. (If you log in with a Google account, it will save each audit so you can track changes to a page over time.)
1. Repeat the process for additional pages as needed. In addition to the homepage, try a few other template pages, like section landing pages or article pages. Page quality will vary based on content, but by focusing on a few key templates, you can quickly get a sense of issues occurring across the site.
