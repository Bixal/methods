what: An automated assessment report of factors that determine web page quality, including performance, accessibility, search engine optimization, and coding best practices.
why: To quickly identify issues that impact the user experience of a website so improvements can be prioritized and addressed before doing more in-depth research.

## How to do it

1. Run the audit.
    - Go to [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure/).
    - Enter the address of the page you want to audit and press `Run Audit`.
    - It may take a minute or two to finish running.
2. Share the results with your team.
    - Have team members provide effort estimates for issues in their area of expertise. There may be issues relating to content, design, and development across each of the four categories.
    - The `View Report` link is a unique address you can bookmark to return to this version of the report later or share it with others. You can also download the report as an HTML file to view offline.
    - There is currently no way to easily export the report contents as a spreadsheet. Instead, go over the results with the team and capture issues in your work tracking system as appropriate.
    - If you log in with a Google account, Measure will save each audit so you can track changes to a page over time.
3. Work with your team to prioritize fixes.
    - Each of the problems identified impacts the overall user experience. Facilitate discussion among the team about which issues to prioritize based on the effort required and impact achieved.
4. Audit additional pages as needed.
    - In addition to the homepage, try a few other template pages, like section landing pages or article pages. Page quality will vary based on content, but by focusing on a few key templates, you can quickly get a sense of issues occurring across the site.
