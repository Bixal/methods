# Make a suggestion

Have an idea for a new feature or find a problem with the current site? We'd love to hear your feedback.

If you work at Bixal, you can [fill out this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=UIFEMerVDk6_Y1G-BXMG0zqbyzpo-WlPtfQBPsrL_3VUM0hPTVRTUlYwSDNXNTc3QTZTQVA0S0FZOS4u) to have your suggestion automatically added to our GitHub repository as an Issue.

If you're outside of Bixal, you'll need a Github account to [create an issue](https://github.com/Bixal/methods/issues/new) as you would in any public repo.
