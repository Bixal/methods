# Introduction Message
These are guidelines and templates for sending an initial introduction to potential study participants requesting their participation.

## Guidelines
* Be clear about who you are and what you’re trying to do. Give minimal but relevant context. Think in terms of how the project might help this person and what type of information you are seeking from them.
* Be clear about what you’re asking of the recipient. Specify the research method (interview, survey, etc.) and the time investment on the recipient’s side. If applicable, include information about an incentive.
* Include information about technology expectations: remote vs. in-person, screen-sharing component, what tool you’ll use to connect, etc.
* Let them know they can ask questions before deciding.
* Avoid using the term ‘research’ as this can have different connotations to different audiences. Use one of these instead: running a study, gathering information, or seeking to learn.
* Avoid using jargon and acronyms the recipient might not be familiar with.
* If relevant, share the name of referring party near the beginning of the email or in the subject line.
* Format the call-to-action in a different style to draw attention to it (bold, italics, etc.).

### **Example**

Hi Frodo,

Bilbo Baggins shared your contact information with me. I’m part of a team working with the Department of Education to improve public hobbit education, and he mentioned you as someone who might be able to give us feedback. We’re doing a series of interviews with hobbit students to hear their experiences and learn where improvements are needed.

Would you have about an hour to talk with us in the next week? The interview would be remote, through Microsoft Teams and have a screen-sharing component. The Department of Education will provide 100 ducats in exchange for your participation.

I’m happy to answer further questions or schedule a time with you.

**Please let me know if you’re interested.**
