# Agreement Message

This is a message you can use to accompany the [participant agreement](https://bixal.github.io/methods/participant-agreement/), whether sending as a link or an attachment.

## Guidance
* The goal of this message is to provide study participants with an agreement form and ask for their signature.
* Avoid too many specifics in this message. Keep it brief and high-level so you donâ€™t have to update both the form and the message.
* Keep in mind that participants may be hesitant to download attachments or click links in messages from people they don't know because of security concerns. It's OK for participants to agree verbally during the session instead.

If you could, **please review, sign, and return the form** before our session. If you are unable to complete the form or have questions, we can go over it together at the beginning of the session.
