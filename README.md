# Methods

The 18F Methods were created to describe how 18F puts human-centered design into practice. While this was developed primarily as an internal resource, we hope it can help *everyone* adopt the methods of human-centered design. 

## Why methods?

In order to function well within cross-functional teams, designers need to know a few things: which methods they might choose from, why one particular method makes more sense than another at any given moment, and, once they’ve picked a method, how to actually execute it. 18F Methods collects this essential information as a series of cards. In practice, we’ve found the Methods can provide folks with a gateway into our work and build internal alignment around a shared vocabulary.

### Specific to 18F, specific to the federal government

It’s important to note that the 18F Methods are designed to account for two things that may not otherwise concern a more generic collection of design methods. First, these methods directly reflect and support 18F’s human-centered work. (They are also continuously updated in a human-centered way — how meta!) Second, 18F Methods are designed to keep federal employees on the happy side of the law. This collection specifically includes helpful information on topics for which designers working in the federal government may need clarification, such as privacy and the [Paperwork Reduction Act](pra.digital.gov).

### Running the Methods website on your local machine

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) ( > version 2.1.5 ). You may consider using a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to help ensure that Ruby version upgrades don’t mean all your [gems](https://rubygems.org/) will need to be rebuilt.

On OS X, you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Ruby in `/usr/local/bin`, which may require you to update your `$PATH` environment variable:

```
shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby
```

To serve 18F Methods locally, using `methods` as the name of your new repository:
Run each of the following steps to get the site up and running.

```
git clone git@github.com:18F/methods
cd methods
bundle install
jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the site at: `http://localhost:4000/`
